# Exercise 1 Lab 8

The three problem to be fixed are:

1. `HANDLE Hon` typo, should be hIn

2. The second call to `fprintf` function is wrong because first parameter for output stream (`stderr`) is missing

3. In the `WriteFile` function is specified the wrong number of bytes to be written (third parameter should be `nIn` instead of `BUF_SIZE`)
