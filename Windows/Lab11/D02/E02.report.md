# Exercise 02 Lab 11

To implement producers/consumers pattern, the following struct has been defined:

```
typedef struct QUEUE {
  UINT head, tail;           // the head and the tail of the queue
	UINT size;                 // the size of the queue
	UINT *buffer;              // the queue
	HANDLE semFull, semEmpty;  // semaphores for read/write management
} QUEUE;
```

When a producer inserts an integer into the queue, it signal through semFull
consumers that there are something to be consumed.

Viceversa consumers signal producers when they read integer from the queue.

The reading and writing between producers and consumers are managed using
critical section.

To terminates consumers once producers end up, a special value is inserted by
main thread into queue. Then main thread signal consumers through semFull.
