# Exercise 2

- Follows the steps for creating a bootable hard disk file image in directory `MK/gdt-idt` and installing the kernel in `src`.

- Use the tutorial in [http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/) to understand the main and the functions that make this minimal kernel.

- Produce a report which illustrates the most important data structures, functions, and instructions that are used to build this kernel. Use figures and tables to make your report easily readable.

- Give also your suggested procedure to debug this kernel (i.e., where would you suggest to put breakpoints and why).
