This repository contains my laboratories related to the academic course I attended at <a href="https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en">Politecnico di Torino</a>.
<br>
<br>
The course analyzes the operating system architecture, and its internal modules. It introduces concepts and techniques for an effective management of the resources of a computer system (processors, memories, devices, files, etc.).
System programming techniques are illustrated through the analysis and use of Unix and Windows system calls.
